# Sitter for Pico-8

This is a game I've made
  [several](https://github.com/aksommerville/lilsitter)
  [times](https://github.com/aksommerville/sitter2009)
  [before](https://github.com/aksommerville/sitter).

It's a fun concept, carry children to the goal and don't let them get killed.

Using as a test case for learning Pico-8.
